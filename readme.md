# AI Summer School 2024  
Organized by Ho-min Park (Ph.D. Student, Ghent University)

We are excited to announce the AI Summer School 2024, following the success of our AI Summer School 2023. This vacation School is an intensive 9-week program from June 24th to August 28th, focused on advancing knowledge and practical skills in artificial intelligence (AI). Our goal is to provide a strong learning environment where participants can develop and refine their AI projects.

## Student Selection

The AI Vacation School selects four students for the beginner group from Ghent University Global Campus students each vacation period. After a prior announcement is made, applicants take a Qualification test during the semester. Students are then selected based on their test scores, with the highest scorers being chosen. The Qualification test consists of 20 questions covering basic linear algebra, calculus, and Python-related problems.


## Benefits of Participation

Participants who successfully complete the program with satisfactory scores on quiz, exam and deliver their final presentation receive several benefits:

Certificate: A certificate signed by the supervising professor is awarded to successful participants.
Internship Opportunities: Graduates of the program are given priority consideration for future internship opportunities within the Research Center.

These benefits provide participants with valuable recognition of their achievements and potential advantages for their future academic and professional endeavors.


## Program Highlights

The Vacation School started with two weeks of lectures and workshops, covering a range of topics from AI basics to more advanced subjects. These sessions, detailed below, were designed to give participants a solid understanding of AI technologies and their real-world applications. The program participants are divided into two groups: the Beginner group, consisting of first-time participants, and the Advanced (plus) group, which includes those who have completed the Beginner level. While the Beginner group attends online lectures, the Advanced group prepares on-site lectures, quizzes, and exams for the Beginner group.


### Online lecture: June 24th - July 5th
After their exams, Beginner group participants are requested to complete 21 hours of [online lectures](https://github.com/powersimmani/AISS2024-Online-lecture-list) over a two-week period. Their learning progress is assessed through a quiz on the first day of the on-site lectures. This approach encourages participants to become familiar with the terminology and concepts of linear algebra, calculus, machine learning, and computer structure/networks.


### On-site Lecture: July 7th - July 19th

During the first two weeks, from July 7th to July 19th (Monday to Friday), the following schedule was followed, including both theoretical and practical sessions:

| Day  | Date       | Morning (10:00 - 12:00)                          | Afternoon (14:00 - 16:00)                 | Presenter       |

This schedule offered a structured approach to learning various AI topics, allowing participants to gradually build their knowledge and skills.

### Self-Study and Project Development (July 20th - August 15th)

Both the Beginner group and the Advanced (plus) group spent a month conducting self-study on their own machine learning-related topics. Notably, unlike the previous round where the Beginner group analyzed toy example data, in this round they analyzed data from a Kaggle competition with prize money at stake.

### Final Presentation (August 27th - 28th)

The program ended with a two-day presentation seminar on August 27th and 28th, where each participant or team showcased their project outcomes. This seminar allowed for the exchange of ideas, feedback, and recognition of the hard work and achievements of all involved.

## Target Audience

The Vacation School was designed for undergraduate students at GUGC who wanted to deepen their understanding and skills in artificial intelligence. This program aimed to include students from various disciplines within GUGC, giving them the opportunity to explore AI concepts and apply them to real-world scenarios. Whether participants were beginners in AI or had some foundational knowledge, this Vacation School was designed to enhance their learning experience and prepare them for future academic or industry challenges in AI.



## Improvement in Quality of Teaching Materials

In this round, multiple Advanced group students participated and shared the responsibility of delivering lectures and practical sessions for the new Beginner group students. Thanks to the numerous participants, we were able to consolidate the previously somewhat disorganized format into a unified one, and make each set of teaching materials much more effective in conveying information. You can also see the improvement in quality and the unification of format in the attached thumbnail image.
